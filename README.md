SketchSense is an interactive web-based system that captures expressive drawing behaviors and predicts a user’s interior design preferences using a structured computational pipeline. The system maps ten drawing-derived parameters to semantic interior-design descriptors and generates a personalized text prompt for a generative model (e.g., Gemini / Nano Banana API) to produce a custom interior rendering.

This repository contains the full source code for the SketchSense interface, style-mapping logic, prompt-generation module, and data-collection pipeline.
